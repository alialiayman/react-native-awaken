## About

Awakened
Have you ever called a contact in the middle of the night? This happens because you don't know the local time of your contact.
This app shows the local time of your contact based on their phone number giving you more contacts to call enhancing your visibility to those contacts.

This app only shows you contacts when their local time is after 9:00 AM and before 6:00 PM, this is very useful for business. You can change this time window in settings and call your friends after 6:00 PM or before 9:00 AM.

Call more people at the right time, and do not calculate their local time this app will do it for you.
